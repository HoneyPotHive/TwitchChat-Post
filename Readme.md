# Currently in process
### Long story short I learned how to write this correctly to meet Twitch demands to mass post in multiple channels at once. To me this looks like a bypass send nonce junk data and how bots work in my 20min research
##  Update 8/26 I can now target or in this case select which channels I want to mass post to, live or not. From here we could potentially build something out where we farm the site since it has decently json format response. Which makes it easy to mass message a group of streams based on genre or game.
